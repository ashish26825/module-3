                        <p>
                           
						Chicken is one of those meat items that finds its place in all Indian meals. A favorite among all age groups, chicken is not
						only easily available, but is also nutritious and healthy if consumed in right quantities.

This lean meat can do wonders for all those non-vegetarians when consumed in a controllable manner. Implementing healthier food habits
 in our diets ensures a good body and better immunity. So here goes some of the numerous benefits of the delightful chicken!
<br><br>
<b>Nutritional value of chicken</b><br>
While chicken is a lean meat with loads of proteins, it is also high on cholesterol. However, chicken provides selenium which contains
 antioxidants that help control free radicals and improve your immune system.

A 100gms of cooked chicken would usually contain 239 calories. Of 100gms, 27gms would be only protein which is important for growth 
and development of various organs in the body. Besides, chicken also helps in maintaining the desired body weight. Furthermore, it 
gives zinc and iron and is an excellent source for Vitamins B6, B12 and D.<br><br>
<b>Body weight maintenance:</b>  With chicken being an excellent source of high quality protein, it helps in maintaining body weight 
especially for obese people. Adequate protein quantities would mean that your stomach stays full leaving no scope for binge eating. 
Including chicken two to three times in a week is not a bad idea, however, ensure to cook it in a healthy way.<br><br>

<b>That toned figure that you desired:</b>  Do you aspire to have a muscular and toned body, then chicken is your answer. The high protein
 content would give you the necessary energy to function properly. However, do ensure to balance it out with enough macro and micro 
 nutrients in your diet.
<br><br>

<b>Strong bones and healthy teeth:</b> The protein content in chicken helps in decreasing bone loss. Bone loss is a major concern for women (aged 30 and above) and the geriatric population.  Consuming 100gms of chicken breast would be sufficient in fulfilling half of your daily protein intake. Furthermore, the phosphorus in chicken helps in maintaining healthy teeth, bones, and ensures proper functioning of kidneys, liver and the central nervous system.
<br><br>
<b>Increased metabolism: </b>Since selenium is present in good quantities, consuming chicken would mean increase in metabolism rates especially the thyroid hormone, antioxidant defense system and immune function of the body.
<br><br>
<b>Protection from cancer:</b> You heard it right! Chicken is rich in niacin, a particular kind of Vitamin B that guards the body against cancer and other genetic complications.

                        <p>
						
						Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric
						times.Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.

Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin
 steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on
 the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is 
 used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, 
 tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although 
 forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the 
 tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked 
 and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock.

Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls, 
because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed 
to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal 
feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38%
 and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest
 consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to
 the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per 
 capita in the world. In comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African countries,
 such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

In 2015, the world's largest exporters of beef were India, Brazil and Australia. Beef production is also important to the economies of Uruguay, 
Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Argentina, Belarus and Nicaragua.

Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein.

                        <p>
						Sushi is a popular Japanese snack and is one of the most famous Japanese dishes across the globe. Sushi consists of
						cold cooked rice seasoned with vinegar and is shaped into bite-sized rolls with raw or cooked fish, egg or vegetables
						and wrapped in seaweed.<br><br>

<b>Nutrition Analysis -</b><br>

Total calories in a single piece of rice-fish sushi are about 35 calories with 1 gm protein, 4 gm carbohydrates, 0.3 gm fat and 0.0 5 gm sodium.

A piece of vegetable-rice sushi contains 28 calories with 0.5 gm protein, 6 gm carbohydrate, negligible fat and 0.01 gm sodium.

Depending on preparations and the type of main ingredients, a single sushi may contain 28 to 60 calories. One sushi meal contains about 
10 pieces so the total calories in a sushi meal can range from 280 to 600 calories.

It is low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Low fat fishes are used like tuna, salmon & halibut. Fruits like avocado are rich sources of 
omega 3 fatty acids. Sushi provides a balance of carbohydrates and lean proteins. Vegetables, which are used as main ingredient also add fiber. 
Protein and fat content varies with the type of main ingredients used with rice.<br><br>

<b>Sushi and Weight Loss -</b><br>

Depending upon the choice of main ingredients, method of preparation and seasonings, sushi can be a part of a healthy diet, but certain 
choices can hamper your weight loss efforts too. It is a low fat meal but with the wrong choices it can be a high calorie meal too.

Choose sushi preparations with raw or cooked low fat fishes as main ingredients instead of fried rolls. Fried rolls with their high oil 
content contain more fat than protein. The less fancy the roll, the better and healthy it is.

Soy sauce seasoning is a staple with sushi. Soy sauce contains high sodium content which is not suitable for people with hypertension and
 can lead to water retention too. Also rice has a tendency to soak a lot when dipped in soy sauce.

Processed white rice in sushi has a high glycemic index of 100, higher than white bread. So, it is not the right food choice for people 
with insulin sensitivity or diabetes. However, brown rice varieties are also available now which is a much healthier option over white rice.

One should avoid sushi rolls with addition of mayo and cream cheese as these add fat and calories.

Incorporating vegetable sushi rolls is also a great option. Sea vegetables, cauliflower, tofu and avocados are widely used.
 Avocados are source of good fat but it should be consumed in moderation as 1 cup sliced avocado contains 234 calories and 21 gm 
 fat and increasing the quantity can add up to total calories in a meal.

People generally eat sushi meals as appetizers followed by a main course which can take total calorie intake to as high as 2000 calories.
 Taking care of portion size is the key rule of a healthy lifestyle. 5 to 6 pieces of sushi is a healthy portion size for a meal at one 
 time. One should avoid adding any other main course dishes to the plate and can start with a clear soup to add bulk and avoid overeating.
